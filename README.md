## Project Overview

Welcome to the NC News Forum! This is my inaugural project where I've dedicated two weeks to build a news forum application with JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL for the backend, and React for the frontend. 

This news forum is a web application that allows users to discuss and share news articles on various topics. It provides a platform for meaningful conversations and staying updated on current events. This project is the result of two weeks of dedicated work, leveraging the power of JavaScript, Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend, and React for the front end.

Reflecting on my first full-stack project as a software developer, I'm proud of the rapid progress and newfound skills I've acquired. Despite having learned Node, React, and SQL just a week before project completion, I quickly became proficient with these frameworks and relational databases.

## Getting Started
### Clone Instructions:
---
If you would like to run this project locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DennisTockan/be-nc-news.git
```

2. Navigate into the repository folder using
```
cd be-nc-news
```

3. Open your new repository in VSCode:
```
code .
```

### Installation of Dependencies:
---

Install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install
```

### Environment Variables Setup:
---
Two new files will need to be created in the main directory. Name these two files `.env.test` and  `.env.development`.

#### Inside .env.test:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

#### Inside .env.development:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

Make sure to include both .env files in your .gitignore to keep sensitive data safe.

### Proceed to Run Setup Scripts and Begin Development
---
1. Seed the local database:
```
npm run setup-dbs
```
2. Seed the database with initial data:
```
npm run seed
```
3. For seeding the production database with data:
```
npm run seed-prod
```

### Running Tests:
---
Execute Jest test suites using the following command, optionally providing an identifier for the file containing test suites to run:
```
npm test OPTIONAL_IDENTIFIER
```






### This is probably the apporach

The primary objective of the backend project is to establish a robust RESTful API. This API has been meticulously crafted to offer a comprehensive array of endpoints, which aligns with the frontend news media web service. Through these endpoints, users are empowered with the capability to engage with and exert control over the data contained within the PostgreSQL database. This has become possible withuse of the versatile CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations, affording users the ability to shape and mold the data to their specific needs and preferences.
