# Northcoders News API üë®‚Äçüíª

## Project Overview

Welcome to the NC News Forum! This is my inaugural project where I've dedicated two weeks to build a news forum application with JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL for the backend, and React for the frontend. 

This news forum is a web application that allows users to discuss and share news articles on various topics. It provides a platform for meaningful conversations and staying updated on current events. This project is the result of two weeks of dedicated work, leveraging the power of JavaScript, Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend, and React for the front end.

Reflecting on my first full-stack project as a software developer, I'm proud of the rapid progress and newfound skills I've acquired. Despite having learned Node, React, and SQL just a week before project completion, I quickly became proficient with these frameworks and relational databases.

### This is probably the apporach

The primary objective of the backend project is to establish a robust RESTful API. This API has been meticulously crafted to offer a comprehensive array of endpoints, which aligns with the frontend news media web service. Through these endpoints, users are empowered with the capability to engage with and exert control over the data contained within the PostgreSQL database. This has become possible withuse of the versatile CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations, affording users the ability to shape and mold the data to their specific needs and preferences.
